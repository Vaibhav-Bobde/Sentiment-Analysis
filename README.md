# Sentiment-Analysis
This project does sentiment analysis using twitter data. It's a web application that employs spark engine to run a python program in the backend to compute sentiment analysis using real-time twitter data. The spark jobs are submitted by the user usign the website after providing a topic for the sentiment analysis.

The project uses:
-Spark engine to perform sentiment analysis on the real time twitter data.
-Third party api, TextBlob, which uses Naive Bayes classifier internally to compute the sentiment.
-ElastiSearch database and Kibana Dashboad which was hosted on the cloud (I hosted it using elasticsearch website for 15 days trial   period).
